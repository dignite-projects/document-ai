# Chat

Paperbase exposes a conversational endpoint that lets users ask questions over their document corpus. The chat runs as a MAF `ChatClientAgent` with retrieval-augmented generation: each turn pulls relevant chunks from the [knowledge index](knowledge-index.md), feeds them into the prompt, and returns a grounded answer with citations.

This page covers the chat as a *feature* — what it does, how to tune it, and what knobs are safe to flip. For end-to-end HTTP request/response shapes (idempotency, retry, error handling), see [chat-client.md](chat-client.md).

## What it can do

- **Anchor-driven, not scope-locked.** A conversation may carry a `documentId` — the document the user opened when starting the chat. This is treated as a **soft anchor** in the system prompt (`id` + `documentTypeCode` only — never the title), not a retrieval constraint. The model is free to (and encouraged to) search across other documents and types, follow `DocumentRelation` edges, and reconcile across the corpus. A conversation without `documentId` behaves the same way, just without the anchor hint.
- **Citations.** Every answer carries the chunk(s) that grounded it. The agent prompt enforces `[chunk N]` citations and the result is post-processed into a structured `citations` array (document id, chunk index, snippet, source name). Citations from multiple `search_paperbase_documents` invocations within one turn are **appended and de-duplicated** — never overwritten — and capped at `MaxCapturedCitations`.
- **Tool calling.** The agent always sees the same flat toolset (built-in tools + every business module's contributor tools). See the [Tools](#tools) section below for the catalog and the fail-closed contract every tool follows.
- **Streaming.** The HTTP API exposes both a buffered `POST .../messages` and a Server-Sent-Events `POST .../messages/stream` endpoint. The streaming endpoint emits `PartialText`, `ToolCallStarted`, `ToolCallCompleted`, and a terminal `Done` (or `Error`) delta — see [client guide → Streaming](chat-client.md#3-stream-a-message-server-sent-events) for the protocol.
- **Idempotent turns.** The client generates a `clientTurnId` per turn; replays with the same id never re-invoke the model. Idempotency applies to both the buffered and streaming endpoints.
- **Optional LLM rerank.** Off by default. When enabled, retrieval recall is expanded `RecallExpandFactor`× and the chat model rescues the most relevant `TopK` before the answer prompt.

## Permissions

| Permission | Grants |
|---|---|
| `Paperbase.Chat` | Read own conversations and messages (default) |
| `Paperbase.Chat.Create` | Create a new conversation |
| `Paperbase.Chat.SendMessage` | Send a message in an existing conversation |
| `Paperbase.Chat.Delete` | Delete an owned conversation |

A user holding only `Paperbase.Chat` can read but not act. Tool contributors enforce their own per-feature permissions on top of this — for example `search_contracts` requires `Contracts.Default` even though the chat permission is already held.

## Configuration

Chat-related knobs live in `PaperbaseAIBehavior` alongside the other Application-layer behavior settings (see [ai-provider.md](ai-provider.md) for the full split between `PaperbaseAI` provider wiring and `PaperbaseAIBehavior` behavior knobs).

```json
"PaperbaseAIBehavior": {
  "EnableLlmRerank": false,
  "RecallExpandFactor": 4,
  "ChatTopK": 5,
  "ChatMinScore": 0.45,
  "MaxCapturedCitations": 50,
  "MaxToolsPerTurn": 0
}
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EnableLlmRerank` | `false` | When enabled, document chat retrieves an expanded candidate set, asks the chat model to rerank chunks by question relevance, and injects only the final `TopK` into the answer prompt. Off by default to conserve tokens; enable when retrieval quality is the bottleneck (often in mixed-language corpora). |
| `RecallExpandFactor` | `4` | Multiplier applied to `ChatTopK` (or `PaperbaseKnowledgeIndex:DefaultTopK`) before LLM rerank. With the defaults `topK=5` × `4` = 20 candidates rescored. |
| `ChatTopK` | `5` | Default top-K passed to `search_paperbase_documents` when the model does not specify it. The model can override per call (e.g. raise to 10–15 for cross-document reconciliation). |
| `ChatMinScore` | `0.45` | Default normalized cosine threshold for document chat RAG searches when the model does not specify `minScore`. Intentionally lower than `PaperbaseKnowledgeIndex:MinScore` to improve recall for cross-language questions and proper-noun lookups. |
| `MaxCapturedCitations` | `50` | Hard upper bound on the number of distinct citations a single turn may accumulate across all `search_paperbase_documents` calls. When the cap is hit, additional results are dropped and `CitationsTrimmed = true` is recorded on the audit row. Defends against prompt-injection-driven citation bombs. |
| `MaxToolsPerTurn` | `0` (unlimited) | Soft cap on the number of contributor tools exposed to the agent per turn. `0` means no cap. When the cap is exceeded, the dispatcher prefers tools whose contributor `DocumentTypeCode` matches the conversation anchor and trims the rest, recording `ToolsTrimmed = true`. Leave at `0` until business modules genuinely outgrow the model's tool-list comprehension. |

The agent uses `ChatToolMode.Auto` — the model picks when (and with what `documentIds` / `documentTypeCode` / `topK` / `minScore`) to invoke each tool. There is no operator switch for "always retrieve before answering" — see *When the answer is degraded* below for the honest-signal contract that replaced it.

Every business-module skill (e.g. `search-contracts`) is advertised on every turn regardless of conversation anchor — there is no per-conversation filter. The chat agent picks which skill (if any) to load based on the user's question. Do not rely on the conversation anchor for authorization — each skill script body re-asserts the relevant feature permission (see *Adding a skill* below).

The hard cap on tool-call rounds within a single turn is configured at host wiring time via `PaperbaseAI:MaxToolIterations` (default `10`); see [ai-provider.md → Provider wiring](ai-provider.md#provider-wiring-paperbaseai). For prompt language behavior, see [ai-provider.md → Cross-cutting LLM behavior](ai-provider.md#cross-cutting-llm-behavior-paperbaseaibehavior). For retrieval `topK` / `minScore` defaults, see [knowledge-index.md](knowledge-index.md). For BM25-augmented hybrid retrieval, see [knowledge-qdrant.md](knowledge-qdrant.md).

## Tools and skills

The chat agent exposes capabilities in two shapes:

- **Always-available tools** — high-frequency primitives registered directly on the agent's `ChatOptions.Tools`. There is exactly one: `search_paperbase_documents`. Every content-class question routes through it, so paying a `load_skill` round-trip is wasted.
- **Agent skills** — domain capabilities advertised by [MAF `AgentSkillsProvider`](https://learn.microsoft.com/agent-framework/agents/skills) ([open spec](https://agentskills.io)) using progressive disclosure. Each skill is advertised in ~100 tokens; the LLM calls `load_skill("name")` only when relevant, then `run_skill_script("name", "invoke", args)` to execute the script body.

The model picks when, in what order, and with what arguments to invoke each — there is no scripted workflow.

### Always-available tool

| Tool | What it does | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `search_paperbase_documents` | Semantic vector search over the user's documents. The model supplies a natural-language `query`; optional `documentIds[]`, `documentTypeCode`, `topK`, `minScore` parameters let it drill in after a skill round. | Tenant-scoped at the binding layer (`_tenantId` is captured in the closure, not derived from `DataFilter`). Defaults from `PaperbaseAIBehavior:ChatTopK` / `:ChatMinScore`. Citations from all calls in one turn are appended + deduplicated up to `MaxCapturedCitations`. |

### Core skills (inline, owned by the platform)

| Skill | Scripts | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `get-document-relations` | `invoke(documentId)` | Bidirectional lookup over the `DocumentRelation` aggregate — returns documents linked to a given `documentId` (manual + AI-discovered edges). Ordered by source (`Manual` first) then by `Confidence` desc, capped at 20 per call. Powers cross-document reasoning chains like contract → matching invoices. See [relation-discovery.md](relation-discovery.md) for how the underlying graph is populated. |
| `document-inspection` | `outline(documentId)` / `excerpt(documentId, query)` | Precise-navigation complement to vector search: `outline` returns the Markdown heading tree (level + title + line number) of a single document — body text omitted, capped at 50 headers per call. `excerpt` is exact-substring grep with 2 lines of surrounding context, capped at 5 matches per call. Vector embeddings underweight precise tokens (contract numbers, invoice IDs, dates, proper nouns); this skill is the literal-match path. |

Both core skills require `Paperbase.Documents.Default` (re-asserted inside each script). Cross-tenant hits collapse to `not_found` so existence is not leaked.

### Business-module skills

Every business module that wants to expose structured queries to the agent ships one or more `AgentClassSkill<TSelf>` subclasses (registered as `ITransientDependency` with `[ExposeServices(typeof(AgentSkill))]`). Reference: the contracts module contributes three skills:

- `search-contracts` — list contracts by counterparty / number / date / amount range — see `modules/contracts/src/Dignite.Paperbase.Contracts.Application/Chat/SearchContractsSkill.cs`
- `get-contract-detail` — fetch a single contract's full extracted field set — see `GetContractDetailSkill.cs`
- `aggregate-contracts` — sum amounts and counts across a filtered contract set — see `AggregateContractsSkill.cs`

See [Adding a skill](#adding-a-skill-business-modules) for the contract every new skill must follow.

### The fail-closed contract

Every script body — core skill, business-module skill, or the always-available `search_paperbase_documents` tool — must satisfy the same three rules, because the LLM (not the HTTP authorization filter) decides when to call it. HTTP-level `[Authorize]` on the AppService does **not** cover these calls.

1. **Explicit permission check** via `IAuthorizationService.CheckAsync(...)`. The Chat permission alone is insufficient — each script re-asserts the feature permission relevant to its data.
2. **Explicit tenant predicate** in the query (`Where(x => x.TenantId == tenantId)`). Do not rely on ABP's ambient `DataFilter` — any code path that disables it would silently leak across tenants.
3. **Hard `Take(N)` row cap** to defend against prompt-injection-driven recall bombs.

Skill scripts resolve `IAuthorizationService` / `ICurrentTenant` / repositories per call via the `IServiceProvider` parameter that MAF auto-injects (see `core/src/Dignite.Paperbase.Application/Chat/Tools/DocumentRelationsTool.InvokeAsync` for the pattern). User-derived free-text fields in the JSON return value are wrapped via `PromptBoundary.WrapField(...)`.

Reverse examples and the rationale: [`.claude/rules/doc-chat-anti-patterns.md`](../.claude/rules/doc-chat-anti-patterns.md), reverse examples C and D.

### Tool-call progress description

The streaming endpoint emits a `ToolCallStarted` delta when the model fires a tool. The label is currently **structural only**: for the always-available `search_paperbase_documents` tool, the binding's `progressDescriber` (e.g. "正在跨全库向量检索…") is used; for skill calls (which surface as MAF's `run_skill_script` / `load_skill` meta-tools) the fallback `"正在执行 {toolName}…"` is rendered. The describer must **never echo raw model arguments** — that would leak data before any per-skill permission check has fired (see [`.claude/rules/doc-chat-anti-patterns.md`](../.claude/rules/doc-chat-anti-patterns.md) reverse example C #4).

## Citation-to-source navigation

`ChatCitationDto` is the UI-facing citation contract. Citation navigation is Markdown-only: every source document type is handled through the extracted `Document.Markdown`, not through a PDF/image/original-file viewer.

| Field | Navigation meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `documentId` | The source document to open. A citation click must navigate to this document even when the active conversation is scoped by `documentTypeCode` and the cited document is not currently displayed. |
| `snippet` | Primary Markdown positioning key. Search the current document Markdown for this text and highlight the first matching range when possible. |
| `chunkIndex` | Optional knowledge-index chunk ordinal for display/debug context only. It is not a stable Markdown anchor after re-embedding and must not drive positioning by itself. |
| `sourceName` | Display label only. Do not parse it for routing or positioning. |

Fallback order:

1. If `documentId` is missing or the document cannot be loaded, keep the citation as non-navigable display text.
2. Open `documentId` in the chat source pane and render the persisted Markdown.
3. Try to locate `snippet` in the current Markdown and highlight the first matching range.
4. If `snippet` cannot be found, show the Markdown without a highlight and keep `chunkIndex` visible as citation context.

This deliberately does not introduce a separate `DocumentSourceLocation` DTO, PDF page navigation, persisted chunk IDs, or stored character offsets. Add exact offsets only after snippet matching proves insufficient in real use.

**Snippet match is whole-document `indexOf`.** The first occurrence of the snippet in the persisted Markdown is highlighted. Re-extracting the document with a different OCR run can shift the persisted Markdown enough that the snippet no longer matches; the UI surfaces this as a visible warning without breaking the chat.

### Developer notes

The source pane is intentionally AI-first. It must render the same Markdown artifact that retrieval, embedding, reranking, and citation snippets are based on. Do not add a parallel PDF/image/original-file source pane for citation navigation.

The original file is still available through the document detail experience, but that is an auxiliary inspection action. A chat citation click must stay on the Markdown source path: load `documentId`, render `Document.Markdown`, then try to highlight `snippet`.

`pageNumber` is not part of the navigation contract. The DTO may still carry it for backward compatibility or future metadata, but new UI and server code must not branch to a PDF viewer, append `#page=N`, or introduce `preferredView: 'pdf' | 'markdown'` based on it.

`chunkIndex` is not a durable anchor. Re-extraction, re-chunking, embedding option changes, or model changes can shift chunk ordinals. Use it in labels, diagnostics, and logs only; never make it the sole positioning key.

Do not add `preferredView` to server DTOs. There is only one citation source view today: Markdown. If exact positioning becomes necessary later, prefer adding Markdown offsets or persisted source ranges after measuring snippet-match failures in production data.

## Grounding source and degraded answers

Every turn carries a `groundingSource` enum on `ChatTurnResultDto` describing what kind of evidence the answer rests on:

| `groundingSource` | Meaning | `isDegraded` |
|---|---|---|
| `None` (0) | The model produced an answer **without invoking any tool** — no search, no contributor tool. Falls back to conversation history and the model's parametric knowledge. | `true` |
| `Vector` (1) | The model invoked `search_paperbase_documents` (and/or other vector-backed retrieval) at least once. Retrieved chunks are reflected in `citations`. | `false` |
| `Structured` (2) | The model invoked only structured/contributor tools (`search_contracts`, `get_contract_aggregate`, `get_document_relations`, …). The answer is grounded in business data, often without text citations. | `false` |
| `Mixed` (3) | The model invoked both vector search and structured tools in the same turn. | `false` |

`isDegraded` is therefore equivalent to `groundingSource == None`. The classification is performed by inspecting the turn's tool-call audit trail in `ChatTelemetryRecorder` — there is no separate flag the model can lie about.

| Cause | What happened | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| Knowledge index unavailable | `IDocumentKnowledgeIndex.SearchAsync` threw — Qdrant down, network fault, etc. The model may still call other tools or fall back to history. | Treat as a transient infrastructure incident. If the model still called structured tools, the turn is `Structured`, not `None`. |
| Model declined to invoke any tool | The model judged the question answerable without retrieval (greetings, follow-up clarifications). | Accept it: an empty `citations` array with `groundingSource = None` and `isDegraded = true` is the honest signal. If a class of questions is consistently answered without tool calls where you want them grounded, tighten the QA system prompt in `DefaultPromptProvider` rather than forcing pre-injection. |

`isDegraded` and `groundingSource` are both surfaced on the API response so the UI can show a "no sources used" banner or a "answered from contract data" badge.

## Auto-generated conversation titles

When the **first** message of a conversation arrives — defined as `ChatConversation.Messages.Count == 0` and the title still equal to the `Chat:UntitledConversation` localization placeholder — `ChatAppService.TryGenerateAndApplyTitleAsync` fires a small extra LLM call right after the main turn finishes. Its job is to produce a 2–3 word conversation title from `(user message, assistant answer)` so the UI sidebar shows something more informative than "Untitled conversation". The result is written via `conversation.Rename(title)` in the same unit of work.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Chat client | **Separate keyed registration** under `PaperbaseAIConsts.TitleGeneratorChatClientKey` — no `UseFunctionInvocation`, no `UseDistributedCache`. Lets the title path be observed independently and lets hosts pick a different (smaller / cheaper) `TitleGeneratorModelId` if desired. Falls back to `ChatModelId` when unset. |
| Prompt | The user's message and the assistant's reply, wrapped in `PromptBoundary` envelopes |
| Instructions | `IPromptProvider.GetConversationTitlePrompt(DefaultLanguage)` — asks for a short title only |
| Token cost | ~200 input / ~5 output per turn (verified against SiliconFlow billing) |
| Failure mode | Try/catch around the whole call — if the LLM errors out, the conversation just keeps its "Untitled" title; no user-visible failure |

On the OTel trace, the title call shows up as a simple `chat <model>` span as a sibling of the main `orchestrate_tools` span — **not nested inside it**, **not wrapped in another `orchestrate_tools`**. That separation makes per-call cost attribution straightforward.

### Disabling or replacing

Override `ShouldGenerateTitle` to return `false` (in a host-level subclass) to skip auto-titling entirely. Override `TryGenerateAndApplyTitleAsync` to plug in a different naming strategy (e.g. take the first 30 chars of the user message verbatim, no LLM call). Both methods are `protected virtual` for that reason.

## Observability

Beyond the OpenTelemetry signals from `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` (see [ai-provider.md → OpenTelemetry signals](ai-provider.md#opentelemetry-signals)), each turn enriches the ABP audit row through `ChatTelemetryRecorder`. Two structured payloads are attached to `AbpAuditLogs.ExtraProperties`:

| Property key | Shape | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Chat.Turn` | `ChatTurnAuditEntry` (single object) | One per turn. Carries `ConversationId`, `Streaming`, `CitationCount`, `IsDegraded`, `ElapsedMs`, `Outcome`, plus the dimensions in the table below. |
| `Chat.ToolCalls` | `IReadOnlyList<ChatToolAuditEntry>` | One entry per tool invocation, in call order. Carries `ToolName`, `ArgumentsSummary` (sanitised — never raw user input), `ResultSizeBytes`, `ElapsedMs`, `Outcome`, `ExceptionType`. |

Notable fields on `Chat.Turn`:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GroundingSource` | enum | `None` / `Vector` / `Structured` / `Mixed` — derived by `ClassifyGrounding` from the per-tool entries, not a flag the model can set |
| `ToolCallDepth` | `int` | Total tool invocations in this turn (sum of `ToolCallSummary` values; includes failed invocations because they reflect actual model behaviour) |
| `ToolCallSummary` | `Dictionary<string,int>` | Per-tool invocation count, e.g. `{ "search_paperbase_documents": 2, "get_contract_detail": 1 }` |
| `CitationsTrimmed` | `bool` | `true` if `MaxCapturedCitations` was hit and additional vector-search hits were dropped |
| `AnchorResolutionFailed` | `bool` | `true` if the conversation has a `documentId` but the per-turn anchor lookup degraded (document deleted, tenant mismatch, or caller lost `Documents.Default`). The turn proceeds **without** the anchor hint — never throws 404. |

These dimensions are what drives the upgrade decision in the future: if production telemetry shows `ToolCallDepth > 8` for ≥ 20% of turns, that is the trigger to evaluate planner sub-agents (Magentic Orchestration). Until then, the single `ChatClientAgent` + flat tool list is intentionally kept simple — see [`.claude/rules/doc-chat-anti-patterns.md`](../.claude/rules/doc-chat-anti-patterns.md) reverse example D for the rationale against premature `AsAIFunction()` sub-agents.

## Adding a skill (business modules)

To let the chat answer business-domain questions ("show contracts with Acme Corp expiring this quarter"), a business module ships one or more [MAF Agent Skills](https://learn.microsoft.com/agent-framework/agents/skills) ([open spec](https://agentskills.io)) — Paperbase consumes the framework primitive directly, no custom contributor abstraction.

The pattern is one capability per skill class:

```csharp
[ExposeServices(typeof(AgentSkill))]
public sealed class SearchInvoicesSkill : AgentClassSkill<SearchInvoicesSkill>, ITransientDependency
{
    public override AgentSkillFrontmatter Frontmatter { get; } = new(
        "search-invoices",
        "Find invoices by structured filters: number, vendor, date, amount range. Use when ...");

    protected override string Instructions => """
        Use this skill when the user asks for a list of invoices ...
        ...detailed how-to-use guidance loaded via `load_skill` only when relevant.
        """;

    [AgentSkillScript("invoke")]
    [Description("Search invoices by structured criteria.")]
    private static async Task<string> InvokeAsync(
        string? vendorName,
        /* other [Description] params */
        IServiceProvider serviceProvider,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        // Fail-closed: explicit auth + explicit tenant predicate + bounded result set.
        var authSvc = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IAuthorizationService>();
        await authSvc.CheckAsync(InvoicePermissions.Default);

        var currentTenant = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<ICurrentTenant>();
        var repo = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IInvoiceRepository>();
        var q = (await repo.GetQueryableAsync()).Where(i => i.TenantId == currentTenant.Id);

        var rows = await /* IAsyncQueryableExecuter.ToListAsync */ (q.Where(...).Take(MaxResultRows));

        // User-derived free-text fields wrapped before serialization.
        return JsonSerializer.Serialize(new
        {
            rows = rows.Select(r => new
            {
                r.Id, r.Amount,
                vendorName = PromptBoundary.WrapField(r.VendorName),
                description = PromptBoundary.WrapField(r.Description)
            })
        });
    }
}
```

Three rules, each enforced at PR review:

1. **`Frontmatter` and `Instructions` are static** — never interpolate user-controlled text. Both feed directly into the LLM context (Frontmatter advertised every turn, Instructions loaded via `load_skill`).
2. **Each script method is fail-closed**: explicit `IAuthorizationService.CheckAsync(...)` for the feature permission + explicit `Where(x => x.TenantId == currentTenant.Id)` (do not rely on ABP's ambient `DataFilter`) + a hard `Take(N)` row cap.
3. **No raw SQL.** Compose queries via `IRepository<T>.GetQueryableAsync()` so all framework filters (soft-delete, tenant, audit) stay in effect. Wrap user-derived free-text fields via `PromptBoundary.WrapField(...)` before serialization.

ABP auto-registers the skill via `[ExposeServices(typeof(AgentSkill))]` + `ITransientDependency`; `ChatAppService` collects every registered `AgentSkill` into a single MAF `AgentSkillsProvider` per turn — no module-side wiring needed beyond the class itself.

**Granularity guideline**: each public capability gets its own skill class (one `Frontmatter` per capability, one `[AgentSkillScript("invoke")]` method). Multiple related scripts on one skill are reserved for cases where they share an intent and the same SKILL.md instructions cover all of them — `document-inspection`'s `outline` + `excerpt` is the canonical example of "two scripts, one intent".

Reference implementations: `modules/contracts/src/Dignite.Paperbase.Contracts.Application/Chat/SearchContractsSkill.cs` (and the sibling `GetContractDetailSkill.cs` / `AggregateContractsSkill.cs` / `ContractSkillHelpers.cs`). Counter-examples and the rationale: [`.claude/rules/doc-chat-anti-patterns.md`](../.claude/rules/doc-chat-anti-patterns.md).
