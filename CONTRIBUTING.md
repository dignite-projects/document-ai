# Contributing to Dignite Document AI

Thank you for considering a contribution. This page covers the practical workflow; the architectural contract lives in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) and is the truth source for what belongs in this repository (and what is explicitly out of scope).

## Development environment

Follow [README → Getting started](./README.md#getting-started-local-development). In short: .NET SDK 10, Node.js 20+, SQL Server (LocalDB works), optionally Docker Desktop for the PaddleOCR sidecar and the local OpenTelemetry dashboard. An OpenAI-compatible LLM API key is mandatory — see [docs/ai-provider.md](./docs/ai-provider.md).

## Running tests

### Backend (xUnit)

All backend test projects are part of the root solution:

```bash
dotnet test Dignite.DocumentAI.slnx
```

Or run individual projects:

```bash
# Core
dotnet test core/test/Dignite.DocumentAI.Domain.Tests
dotnet test core/test/Dignite.DocumentAI.Application.Tests
dotnet test core/test/Dignite.DocumentAI.EntityFrameworkCore.Tests
dotnet test core/test/Dignite.DocumentAI.Mcp.Tests
dotnet test core/test/Dignite.DocumentAI.Ocr.VisionLlm.Tests

# Host
dotnet test host/test/Dignite.DocumentAI.Host.Tests
```

### Frontend (Vitest)

```bash
cd angular
npm install
npm test          # vitest run
npm run lint
```

## Code conventions

- **ABP conventions** — `.claude/rules/abp-core.md` and the other files under [`.claude/rules/`](./.claude/rules/) are normative (dependency direction, base classes, `IClock`, repositories, anti-patterns). They are written for AI coding assistants but apply equally to human contributors.
- **Architecture rules** — [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) defines the channel boundary: Markdown-first data flow, the two-layer document-type model, the exit contracts, and the security covenant for LLM call paths (`.claude/rules/llm-call-anti-patterns.md`).
- Middleware is configured **only** in the host application, never in core modules.

## Issue-first principle

Any change that touches a **channel boundary** — the OCR / text-extraction pipeline, exit contracts (REST / MCP / EventBus / Webhook, event payloads), the field architecture, the document-type tier system, the Markdown-first contract, or the security covenant — must start with a GitHub Issue and reach consensus there **before** any code is written. This is rule 3 of CLAUDE.md's processing rules.

Pure implementation details (bug fixes, wording corrections) don't need an Issue — a descriptive commit message is enough.

Also note CLAUDE.md's "OUT of scope" list: business modules (contract / invoice / HR management), RAG features (vectorization, retrieval, chat), and end-user LLM configuration are not accepted into this repository — downstream consumers build those in their own repositories against the exit contracts.

## Commit style

The repository uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat(scope): …`, `fix: …`, `docs: …`, `chore: …`, `refactor(scope): …`. Existing commit descriptions are mostly written in Chinese; both Chinese and English descriptions are accepted — pick whichever expresses the change most clearly.

## Pull requests

- Target the `main` branch.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) must pass: it builds the core solution and the host, runs the backend test suites (Domain, Application, EntityFrameworkCore, MCP, OCR VisionLlm, and host), and builds / lints / tests the Angular workspace.
- Keep PRs scoped to one concern, and reference the related Issue (required for boundary-touching changes, see above).
- Use the PR template checklist (`.github/pull_request_template.md`).

## Versioning and releases

The project follows three-part [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`), as declared in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md). SemVer is not cosmetic here: the version **is** the stability signal to downstream consumers. A breaking change to an exit contract (REST / MCP / EventBus / Webhook, event payloads, `TextExtractionResult` shape) requires a `MAJOR` bump; a backward-compatible addition (e.g. a new nullable named field) is a `MINOR`; a fix that changes no contract is a `PATCH`.

- **Pre-1.0 (`0.y.z`)** — the exit contracts are still being shaped (Webhook is not yet shipped; the field architecture is evolving). Under `0.y.z`, consumers should expect contracts to change. Graduating to `1.0.0` is an earned milestone — all four exits present, the contracts validated against at least one real downstream consumer — not a default for the first release.
- **Pre-release suffixes** — use SemVer pre-release tags for previews on the way to a stable version: `0.1.0-preview.1` → `0.1.0-rc.1` → `0.1.0`. Both NuGet and npm understand their precedence (a suffixed version always ranks below the matching final version) and treat them as non-stable by default.
- **Do not use CalVer** (e.g. `2026.6.0`) — it communicates *when* a release was cut, not whether it is *safe to upgrade*, which is the opposite of what this project's positioning needs.

### Where the version lives

| Property | Segments | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `<Version>` in [`common.props`](./common.props) | 3-segment SemVer | The NuGet package version and the value a `v*` tag must match. **This is the release version.** |
| `<AssemblyVersion>` | 4-segment | Keep coarse and stable (e.g. `0.1.0.0`); do not move it for every `MINOR`/`PATCH`, to avoid assembly-binding churn. The 4-segment `1.0.0.0` form belongs here — never as a package version or tag. |
| `<FileVersion>` | 4-segment | Diagnostic only; CI may stamp it from a build number or commit count. |
| `version` in [`angular/packages/document-ai/package.json`](./angular/packages/document-ai/package.json) | 3-segment SemVer | The npm package version. **Keep it in lockstep with `<Version>`** as a single product version, until the backend and frontend release cadences genuinely diverge. |

### Cutting a release

1. Move the CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` section to `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`.
2. Confirm `<Version>` in `common.props` and the npm `version` match the intended release (tags do not drive the version — the release workflow reads it from `common.props`).
3. Tag and push: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`. The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) triggers on `v*` tags; `workflow_dispatch` only builds artifacts and does not create a GitHub Release.
4. The npm package (`@dignite/document-ai`) is **published manually** for now — see the header comment in `release.yml`.
